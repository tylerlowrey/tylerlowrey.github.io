## Websites I recommend
- [3Blue1Brown.com](https://www.3blue1brown.com) - This website is a great supplement for learning math. It has great visualizations as well as intuitive explanations of many math concepts. 
- [neovim.io](https://neovim.io) - This is the website for my favorite code editor. It takes getting used to but the amount of useful plugins and customization potential makes it a really great tool.
- [pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com) - This website allows you to compile a list of pc parts and check prices and hardware compatibility. I use it every time I build a new pc for myself or friends so that I don't make a mistake when choosing parts. You can also save the part list so that you can come back to it later.
